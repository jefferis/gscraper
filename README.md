# gscraper

## Installation
Currently there isn't a released version on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/).

Therefore the recommendation is to install from github using the **remotes** package to install the development version:

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("gscraper/jefferis")
```

Note: Windows users need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to install this way.
